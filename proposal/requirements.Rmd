# Requirements
<!-- 
An idea of what is required to make the project actually happen
-->

## People
<!--
Who needs to be involved, what's the proposed structure, what will it take to get their involvement?
-->

This is the same core project team than for the first stage of the
work, which will lead the work for all deliverables. This stage will
likely be less collaborative than the first stage, as it focuses on
writing documentation and packaging the code, although all
contributors will be welcome.

In particular, we request \$10,000 in salary for 1.84 months of Matt
Boone, Data Scientist at the University of Florida. Matt has a solid
experience in R which complements that of other team members, and will
be the main developer and contributor to the codebase. As all other
contributions will be in-kind, having Matt fully dedicated guarantees
successful completion of the project.


## Processes
<!-- 
What processes need to be put in place e.g. codes of conduct, regular ISC meetings, handover to the community at large?
-->

We will follow the same principles of openness than before, relying on
a community-based code of conduct that aims to be inclusive, and a
work that will happen entirely publicly, using the GitHub repository.


## Tools & Tech
<!--
What is going to be needed to deliver this project? 

Will cloud computing be used - if yes are there are necessary components that will be deciding factors between providers?

Are there tools or tech that don't exist that will be produced to facilitate the project?
-->

No technical constraint is foreseen. All team members are already
equipped with enough computer power to work on the project.  The
development platform (GitHub) is already set up and public, and will
remain open to the entire Movement community.


## Funding
<!-- 
[TO DO] THE GUIDANCE IS PRETTY UNCLEAR, ESP IN LIGHT OF GABOR'S PROPOSAL VS AWARD SIZE

-->

We request a total of \$10,000 to support 1.84 months of Matt Boone,
Data Scientist (Biological Scientist II) in the MabLab at the
University of Florida.

* Salary: \$7,369
* Fringe rate (35.70 %): \$2,631
* **Total award = \$10,000**


## Summary
<!--
A summary of the requirements that contextualises the costs
-->

Salary to support a Data Scientist is requested to have one person
committed to the project, who will dedicate set chunks of time to the
work. This seems required to ensure project completion in the proposed
timeline. Almost 8 weeks of work is a reasonable amount of time, which
matches proposed deliverables. All other contributions, from core team
members and other contributors, will be in-kind.
