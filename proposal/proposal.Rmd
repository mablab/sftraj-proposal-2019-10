# The proposal
<!--
This is where the proposal should be outlined.

## Overview
<!--
At a high-level address what your proposal is and how it will address the problem identified. Highlight any benefits to the R Community that follow from solving the problem. This should be your most compelling section.
-->

During the first stage of the work (September 2019 until March 2020),
we will work on the technical foundations of `sftraj` to deal with
tracking data in R. The second stage of the work (this proposal,
Marchâ€“June 2020) will focus on providing solid documentation of the
package and its specifications, targeting both users and package
developers, which is essential for a broad adoption of the `sftraj`
package.


## Detail
<!--
Go into more detail about the specifics of the project and it delivers against the problem.

Depending on project type the detail section should include:

 - [ ] Minimum Viable Product
 - [ ] Architecture
 - [ ] Assumptions

In the first stage of the work, we will define a precise data model
for trajectories. This is currently work-in-progress, but we already
have a conceptual model to guide the work and the implementation in R
(Fig.2). This model recognizes the duality of locations
(i.e. *tracking data* in the form of geographic $(x,y,z)$ and temporal
$(t)$ coordinates) and steps (i.e. the straight-line segment
connecting two successive locations), and thus the need to provide
collections of locations (a `Track` in our conceptual model) and steps
(a `Trajectory`) in the implementation.

```{r data-model, echo = FALSE, out.width = "75%", fig.cap = "Proposed conceptual model for the 'sftraj' package using UML.", fig.align = "center", fig.pos = "!t"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/conceptual-model.png")
```

As we just have started the work on `sftraj`, we have opened a step of
brainstorming with the R Movement community, as to gather as much
feedback as possible to be able to account for all requirements for
trajectory objects. All the development happens in the open, on the
`sftraj` GitHub account (https://github.com/mablab/sftraj), where we
have already collected feedback in the form of 4 use cases in only 3
days (https://github.com/mablab/sftraj/issues?q=label%3Ause-case).  As
we work on a final implementation, it has already become clear to us
that we need to consider features that were planned for later. For
instance, the implementation of a measure of error (typically the
error in GPS positions) has been requested, and might need to be
implemented early in the development of `sftraj`. This and other
user-contributed requests, as they were only considered as future work
in our previous proposal, will limit the delivery of features that
were only planned as optional. Among these were the addition of a
vignette, and the submission of the package to CRAN.

The second stage of work will entirely be focused on documenting and
detailing the internals of `sftraj` for both users and developers.
The addition of a vignette and the submission of the package to CRAN
will actually form the first layer of the work, which will culminate
in the preparation and submission of `sftraj` to rOpenSci
(https://ropensci.org/), and the preparation and submission of a
manuscript detailing `sftraj` from a technical perspective to the R
Journal.
