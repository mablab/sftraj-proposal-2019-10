# The proposal
<!--
This is where the proposal should be outlined.

## Overview
<!--
At a high-level address what your proposal is and how it will address the problem identified. Highlight any benefits to the R Community that follow from solving the problem. This should be your most compelling section.
-->

During the first stage of the work (September 2019 until March 2020),
we will be working on the technical foundations of `sftraj` to deal with
tracking data in R. The second stage of the work (this proposal,
Marchâ€“June 2020) will focus on providing solid documentation of the
package and its specifications, targeting both users and package
developers, which is essential for a broad adoption of the `sftraj`
package.


## Detail
<!--
Go into more detail about the specifics of the project and it delivers against the problem.

Depending on project type the detail section should include:

 - [ ] Minimum Viable Product
 - [ ] Architecture
 - [ ] Assumptions

In the first stage of the work, we will define a precise data model
for trajectories. This is currently work-in-progress, but we already
have a conceptual model to guide the work and the implementation in R
(Fig.2). This model recognizes the duality of locations
(i.e. *tracking data* in the form of geographic $(x,y,z)$ and temporal
$(t)$ coordinates) and steps (i.e. the straight-line segment
connecting two successive locations), and thus the need to provide
collections of locations (a `Track` in our conceptual model) and steps
(a `Trajectory`) in the implementation.

```{r data-model, echo = FALSE, out.width = "75%", fig.cap = "Proposed conceptual model for the 'sftraj' package using UML.", fig.align = "center", fig.pos = "!t"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/conceptual-model.png")
```

As we just have started the work on `sftraj`, we have opened a
collaborative brainstorming space within the R Movement community, to
gather as much feedback as possible to account for all
requirements for trajectory objects. The development of each stage of 
the project happens in the open, on the `sftraj` GitHub account
(https://github.com/mablab/sftraj), where we have already feedback
from the community in the form of use cases
(https://github.com/mablab/sftraj/issues?q=label%3Ause-case).  

As we work on a final implementation, it has already become clear to
us that we need to consider features that were originally planned for
later. For instance, the implementation of an error measure
(typically the error in GPS positions) has been requested, and might
need to be implemented early in the development of `sftraj`. Since this and
other user-contributed requests were considered as future
work in our previous proposal, the delivery of other features, such as
the addition of a vignette, and the submission of the package to CRAN,
will be delayed. 

The second stage of work will entirely be focused on documenting and
detailing the internals of `sftraj` for both users and developers.
The first layer of the work will consist of the preparation of a vignette
and the submission of the package to CRAN, to then focus
on the preparation and submission of `sftraj` to rOpenSci
(https://ropensci.org/), and the preparation and submission of a
manuscript detailing `sftraj` from a technical perspective to the R
Journal.
