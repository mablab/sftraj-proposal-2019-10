Movement defined broadly plays a central role in fields as diverse as
transportation, sport, ecology, music, medicine, and data science
(Gudmundsson *et al.* 2012). As a matter of fact, thanks to global
navigation satellite system (GNSS) and radio-frequency identification
(RFID), miniaturized tracking devices have become nearly ubiquitous,
and resulted in an ever-increasing volume of localization data from
various moving objects, such as humans or animals; cars, boats or
planes; the hand of a musician playing a violin in 3 dimensions; the
entire movement of an orchestra or a flock of starlings; or the eye of
a person that changes its focus from one object to the other. Sampling
all these movements results in the same type of data called *tracking
data*, in the form of geographic ($x,y,z$) and temporal coordinates
($t$) (Joo *et al.* 2019). 

Despite this common nature, there is a critical lack of standard
infrastructure to deal with movement. As a matter of fact, the
Movement community in R, while very dynamic, is also heavily
fragmented (Joo *et al.* 2019).  We have listed 57 packages that
process, visualize and analyze tracking data, one third of which
worked in isolation, not being linked to any other tracking package
(Fig.1). While the package `adehabitatLT` has gained some traction in
the community, the `ltraj` class it proposes is now fairly outdated,
and for instance does not play well with recent spatial classes from
`sf`.

```{r r-ecosystem, echo = FALSE, out.width = "75%", fig.cap = "Network representation of the dependency between 57 tracking packages in R. Solid arrows go towards the package the others depend on. From Joo *et al.* 2019.", fig.align = "center", fig.pos = "t"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/r-ecosystem-depend.png")
```

In a nutshell, this work in isolation is for large part due to a lack
of a modern infrastructure to deal with trajectories in R.  We
recently started the work on the `sftraj` package, a project supported
by the **R Consortium**, to address this gap. `sftraj` aims to address
two specific objective:

1. Propose a central class and basic functions to build, handle,
   summarize and plot movement data;
2. Build an ecosystem of packages that rely on `sftraj` for the data
   part.

The first objective is the subject of our initial stage of work,
i.e. the first 6 months of the project (September 23, 2019 until March
02, 2020, already supported by the **R Consortium**). This proposal
builds on the technical solution provided by `sftraj` at the end of
the first stage to address the second objective, and ensure global
adoption of `sftraj` by the R Movement community.
