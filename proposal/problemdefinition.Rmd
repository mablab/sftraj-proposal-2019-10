# The Problem
<!-- 
Outlining the issue / weak point / problem to be solved by this proposal. This should be a compelling section that sets the reader up for the next section - the proposed solution!

Movement defined broadly plays a central role in fields as diverse as
transportation, sports, ecology, music, medicine and data science
(Gudmundsson *et al.* 2012). As a matter of fact, miniaturized
tracking devices have become nearly ubiquitous, and resulted in an
ever-increasing volume of *tracking data* (Joo *et al.* 2019).
However, there is a critical lack of standard infrastructure to deal
with movement. As a matter of fact, the Movement community in R, while
very dynamic, is also heavily fragmented (Joo *et al.* 2019).  We have
listed 58 packages that process, visualize and analyze tracking data,
half of which worked in isolation, not being linked to any other
tracking package (Fig.1). While the package `adehabitatLT` has gained
some traction in the community, the `ltraj` class it proposes is now
fairly outdated, and for instance does not play well with recent
spatial classes from `sf`.

```{r r-ecosystem, echo = FALSE, out.width = "75%", fig.cap = "Network representation of the dependency between 58 tracking packages in R. Solid arrows go towards the package the others depend on. From Joo et al. 2019.", fig.align = "center", fig.pos = "t"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/r-ecosystem-depend.png")
```

In a nutshell, this work in isolation is mostly due to a lack of a
modern infrastructure to deal with trajectories in R.  We recently
started working on the `sftraj` package, a project supported by the
**R Consortium**, to address this gap. `sftraj` aims to address two
specific objectives:

1. Provide a central class and basic functions to build, handle,
   summarize and plot movement data;
2. Contribute to the foundations of a true community in the ecosystem
   of packages that relies on `sftraj` for handling tracking data.

The first objective is the subject of our initial stage of work,
i.e. the first 6 months of the project (September 23, 2019 until March
02, 2020, already supported by the **R Consortium**). This proposal
builds on the technical solution provided by `sftraj` at the end of
the first stage to address the second objective, and ensure global
adoption of `sftraj` by the R Movement community.
